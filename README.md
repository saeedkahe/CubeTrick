### Hello👋
Welcome to Cube Practice.❤️<br>
In this exercise, we come to the important topic of transform.<br>

### first 
<hr>
In the first step, we create the HTML file.<br>
We create our own tags inside the HTML file. We must be careful to consider a parent for the children.<br>

### second
<hr>
In the second step, we create our own style file.<br>
I used the styling inside the HTML file here. My suggestion to you is to make a CSS file.<br>
In the second step, we value the children relative to the center (parent).<br>
In order for you to understand this issue better, I have named each part.<br>

### Good luck!😘<br>
